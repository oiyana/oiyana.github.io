## CHALLENGE

I joined NYT Games during hyper-growth following the Wordle acquisition, with millions of new casual players entering the ecosystem.

Before Wordle, users were primarily news readers who played Crosswords—the pinnacle of puzzle games—and a traditional anchor for subscriptions. After Wordle, the influx of new audiences was more casual and less attracted to Crosswords.

The business model was simple: play the daily game for free, and subscribe to access Crosswords and all levels in Spelling Bee. But the daily puzzle had a fundamental limitation: a **24‑hour shelf life**. After that, it was gone.

With millions of casual Wordle players, the strategic question became:

> **“Come for Wordle, stay for…?”**

### STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR GROWTH  

Our goal was to increase player engagement by moving players down the funnel to the most habituated surfaces and deepening their relationship with NYT Games.

This was a multi-dimensional strategy, set by the VP of Product, that mapped the user journey across three axes:

- **Monetization** – Convert free players → registered users → paying subscribers **(my responsibility)**  
- **Engagement depth** – Convert low-engaged → mid-engaged → high-engaged players **(my responsibility)**  
- **Platform** – Convert mobile web + desktop users → Games app

### THE HARD PARTS

1. **Organizational alignment**  
   Leadership wanted features before the technical foundation and user validation were in place. Getting buy-in and alignment across teams for resource negotiation and priority trade-offs was critical.

2. **Team and tech stack maturity**  
   I joined during an org transformation from siloed game teams to a more integrated tech organization. We navigated growing pains as teams adopted mature processes, enterprise-standard infrastructure, and the capability to architect systems at scale.

3. **“Go all in” culture vs. ship–learn–iterate**  
   Every launch carried high stakes and scrutiny. Experimentation was often misunderstood or underutilized as an optimization tool, making it harder to run lightweight tests and iterate quickly.

## APPROACH

Build **interconnected value pillars** that compound over time and work across the entire portfolio.

### 1. Puzzle Archives – Maximize ROI for Every Human‑Crafted Puzzle

- Launched full archives for Wordle, Connections, Spelling Bee, and Strands, expanding our core value proposition to the most engaged games beyond Crossword.  
- Transformed 24‑hour shelf-life puzzles into permanent, playable libraries.  
- Extended delight and allowed players to catch up on missed puzzles.  
- Positioned archives as both a **subscriber value** and a **churn mitigation** tool.

### 2. Stats & Streaks – Modernize Progress-Tracking Infrastructure

- Advocated for and partnered with the platform team to fully migrate game progress from client-side to server-side.  
- Introduced the concept of **game-agnostic metrics** alongside **game-specific stats**, setting the foundation for durable progress tracking.  
- Created the infrastructure needed for achievements and metagame mechanics that deepen player habituation.

### 3. Achievement System – Celebrate Wins and Capture Memories

- Built a scalable achievement system that drives engagement across a range of player types and business needs.  
- Designed earning paths for casual to hardcore players: all-in completionists, gregarious sharers, collectors, and overachievers.  
- Introduced time-limited badge drops for special moments (annual events, personal milestones) to create FOMO and memorable experiences.

## LEARNINGS

- **Compounding systems beat isolated features for retention.**  
  Stats drive archive play; archives unlock achievements; achievements create new stats to track. Each pillar reinforces the others, creating durable value that algorithm changes can’t easily disrupt.

- **Builder-first culture requires foundation advocacy.**  
  In organizations that aren’t naturally builder-first, you have to trade short-term feature pressure for long-term platform capability. I learned to show incremental ROI (2 years → 1.5 years → 1 year → <1 year) to justify continued infrastructure investment while navigating constraints and competing priorities.

- **Execution reality: build a scalable foundation.**  
  Each iteration taught us how to build faster, better, and more scalable—creating a turnkey foundation that drives higher ROI with each subsequent game we plug into the system.
