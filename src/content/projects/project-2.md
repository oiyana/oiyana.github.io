## Overview

At BuzzFeed, I led a rapid experimentation program that shipped 60 original mini games over 18 months. The goal: figure out what casual game formats could meaningfully drive repeat visits, session depth, and social sharing on a media platform.

This wasn't a traditional product build — it was a structured creative experiment at scale.

## The challenge

BuzzFeed had an enormous audience but struggled with repeat engagement. Quizzes drove huge traffic spikes but rarely brought people back. Games felt like a natural extension, but nobody knew which formats would resonate or whether the audience would show up for something that wasn't news or entertainment content.

## The approach

Rather than betting on a single format, I designed a lightweight production process that let us ship a new game every 1–2 weeks. Each game was a real product — playable, shareable, tracked — but scoped to be buildable in a tight window.

We tested:
- **Word games** — variations on word association, spelling, and pattern recognition
- **Trivia formats** — timed, themed, head-to-head
- **Puzzle mechanics** — spatial, logic, and drag-and-drop
- **Social games** — formats built for sharing results (predating Wordle's share feature)

## What we learned

Some formats had legs; most didn't. The ones that worked shared a few traits: fast first-play, satisfying difficulty curves, and a shareable result that didn't require context to appreciate. That learning directly shaped how I think about game design today.

The program also surfaced a key organizational insight: media companies can build game habits, but only if the games feel native to the brand's voice — not like they were bolted on.
