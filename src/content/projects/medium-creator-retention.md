## CHALLENGE

Medium was losing writers to Substack. Years of algorithm changes had eroded trust—writers saw their reach fluctuate unpredictably as the platform prioritized different signals (claps, read time, curation, publications). With payouts tied to the traffic their articles generated, many creators felt they'd lost control over their livelihoods.

Writers wanted what Substack offered: guaranteed audience ownership and direct reader relationships, independent of algorithmic distribution.

This wasn’t just a creator problem—it was an existential threat. Medium is a lifeline for indie writers. With 700,000 paying subscribers and 85–100 million monthly readers in 2021, the platform’s value proposition depended on a thriving creator ecosystem. Without writers, we'd lose readership and community.

## MY ROLE

I joined to lead the Creators initiatives, partnering with design leadership and UX research to understand writer needs and execute solutions.

Many of the problems were already known—my role was execution-focused: ship the right features fast, coordinate cross-functional work, and measure impact.

## APPROACH

The strategy was to **give writers audience ownership and control** _within_ Medium so they didn’t have to leave the platform to build durable relationships with readers.

### 1. Email Subscription Redesign

- Let writers build direct newsletter subscriber relationships independent of the algorithm.  
- Full deep-dive below.

### 2. Referred Membership Program

- Enabled writers to earn a revenue share from reader conversions, creating income beyond traffic-based payouts.  
- Co-led with a monetization PM. The program was later sunset in 2025.

### 3. Lists

- Allowed writers to curate lists of stories by topic, showcasing their expertise and driving engagement.

### 4. Customizable About Page

- Gave writers a better way to express their personal brand and differentiate themselves on Medium.

### 5. Email List Import

- Let writers bring readers from other platforms onto Medium.  
- Shipped ~6 months after launch of the email subscription redesign.

### 6. Fix Follower Count

- Removed spam accounts to show writers their true fan base, rebuilding trust in audience metrics.

## DEEP-DIVE: Email Subscription Redesign

### Problem

Writers couldn't reliably reach their most engaged readers, which threatened Medium’s defensibility against Substack.

Email subscription had launched six months before I joined but struggled with adoption:

- Fewer than 10% of writers had enabled email subscriptions.  
- Fewer than 50% of those who enabled it actually sent newsletters.  
- 55% of surveyed writers were unaware the feature even existed.  
- Only ~10K emails were sent monthly out of 1.3M stories published.

Despite this, there were encouraging signals:

- Writer emails had ~40% open rates (10 points above Medium’s Digest Newsletter).  
- 50% of email subscribers read 3+ stories from subscribed writers within 90 days.

Engaged readers existed—we just needed to connect them with writers.

### Strategic Bet

If we could give writers **direct audience ownership _within_ Medium**, we could retain creators while preserving our discovery advantages (curation, publications, built-in readership).

We focused on four pillars:

1. **Increase creator adoption**  
   - Remove double opt-in requirements.  
   - Increase in-product awareness through onboarding prompts.  
   - Build educational content with Creator Relations.

2. **Improve subscriber conversion**  
   - Redesign subscribe CTAs across the reading experience.  
   - Personalize subscription landing pages.  
   - Enable email list import so writers could bring their audiences from elsewhere.

3. **Give writers a feedback loop**  
   - Build an audience dashboard showing followers and email subscribers, embedded in the post stats writers checked daily.

4. **Drive engagement between writers and audiences**  
   - Enable reader replies to writer emails.  
   - Integrate comments more tightly into the email experience.

### Cross-functional Collaboration

- Partnered with Legal on safely removing double opt-in.  
- Worked with Marketing on launch communications.  
- Collaborated with Creator Relations on awareness campaigns and education.  
- Aligned with Customer Success to ensure support and success teams could assist writers.  
- Recruited six engineers mid-sprint to increase capacity and parallelize work.  
- Ran this initiative in parallel with the referred membership program (different PM lead, shared resources).

## IMPACT

### Improve Adoption of Email Subscription

Compared to pre-redesign:

- Nearly **6× total active subscribers** (350K → 2.06M).  
- **100× daily email volume** (1,200 → 100K–200K subscribers receiving emails).  
- **70× monthly email sends** (10K → 726K), massively increasing writer-driven distribution.  
- A double-digit percentage of the writer base activated and sending newsletters regularly.  
- Maintained ~40% open rates at scale.

### Increase Writer Engagement on Platform

- Over half of subscribers read 3+ stories from subscribed writers in 90 days.  
- Writers checked the audience dashboard daily, treating it as a core tool.  
- Writers organically promoted email subscriptions in their stories.  
- Post-launch surveys showed positive sentiment and renewed trust among creators.

### Broader Creator Initiatives

- The referred membership program created a new revenue stream for ~20% of writers.  
- Lists enabled content curation and helped writers showcase topical expertise.  
- Customizable About pages gave writers clearer brand differentiation.  
- Follower cleanup rebuilt trust in the authenticity of reach and audience size metrics.

## LEARNING

Rebuilding trust is harder than building a product.

With writers already skeptical after years of algorithm changes, shipping feature parity with competitors wasn’t enough. We had to **earn back their trust**. That meant:

- Investing in product marketing, detailed help documentation, and Creator Relations outreach.  
- Communicating transparently about what we were changing and why.  
- Showing, through data and lived experience, that Medium was committed to writer success.

Working alongside Product Design, Product Marketing, and Creator Relations—teams deeply committed to writers—reinforced that **trust requires relentless effort and true cross-functional collaboration**.
