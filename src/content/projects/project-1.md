## Overview

As Product Director at The New York Times Games, I lead product strategy and execution for Wordle, Connections, Spelling Bee, and Crosswords. NYT Games is one of the fastest-growing subscription products in the Times portfolio, with tens of millions of players engaging daily.

My work spans the full product lifecycle — from shaping long-term strategy with leadership to working closely with design, engineering, and editorial on the details that make each game feel right.

## What I focus on

**Retention and habit formation** — Daily games live or die by whether players come back tomorrow. I think deeply about streak mechanics, difficulty curves, onboarding, and the subtle cues that make a habit stick without feeling manipulative.

**Cross-game experience** — Each game has its own personality, but players increasingly move between them. I work on the connective tissue: shared accounts, unified notifications, and a Games home that feels cohesive rather than a collection of separate products.

**Subscription growth** — Games is a meaningful driver of NYT subscriptions. I partner with the growth and marketing teams to understand how games convert free players to subscribers and how to lower friction at the moment intent is highest.

## The work in practice

Day to day, this means writing strategy docs and PRDs, running weekly planning with my team, reviewing design and eng work in progress, and representing the Games product perspective in cross-functional conversations with editorial, marketing, and platform teams.

I care a lot about quality — not just shipping, but shipping things that feel right to the people who play every day.
