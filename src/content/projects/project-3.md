## Overview

At BuzzFeed, I led the product development of an internal data tool that gave editors real-time visibility into content performance — and connected those insights directly to distribution decisions powered by ML.

## The problem

BuzzFeed produced an enormous volume of content across formats and verticals. Editors had access to raw analytics but lacked the context to act on it: Which posts were underperforming relative to their potential? Where should distribution be amplified? What signals predicted a post breaking out?

The existing tools were fragmented — different dashboards for different data sources, no single place where editorial judgment and data could meet.

## What I built

I worked with data science, engineering, and editorial to design a unified tool that:

- **Surfaced content performance in context** — not just raw numbers, but benchmarked against similar content and the editor's own history
- **Connected to ML distribution** — the tool fed signals into an automated distribution system that could boost posts on social and push channels without manual intervention
- **Gave editors control** — editors could override recommendations, add context, and see why the system was making the calls it made

## The outcome

The tool became part of the daily workflow for editorial teams across verticals. Editors who used it regularly saw measurable improvements in content reach without having to become data analysts themselves.

It also surfaced a broader principle I've carried forward: the best internal tools make the implicit explicit — they show people what they already half-knew, clearly enough to act on.
